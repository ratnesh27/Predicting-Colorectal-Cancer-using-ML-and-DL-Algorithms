# Predicting-CRC-using-ML-and-DL-Algorithms
The project includes Python-based data science approach using libraries like NumPy &amp; Matplotlib for data analysis, visualization &amp; prediction.

The  Histopathology  image  Dataset  was  split  into  three  sets:  Training, Validation, and Test. The output labels include Cancerous (Malignant) and Non-cancerous (Benign). The images were converted into grayscale and then were resized and resampled, as a part of data preprocessing, to enhance better classification accuracy. After splitting the preprocessed data into training and testing, the CNN based VGG-16 was fitted into the data and was implemented for 10 epochs. Further, Tensor flow lib was used for Model Testing to give predictions for new and unseen images.
